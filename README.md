📊 Excel Project: Vrinda Store Data Analysis

🚀 I recently completed a data analysis project in Excel! While I'm accustomed to creating dashboards in Power BI, I discovered that Excel can also produce impressive dashboards.

🔍 Project Objective: This project analyzes the sales data of Vrinda Store for the year 2022 to understand customer behavior and ultimately increase sales in the coming year.

🔧 Analytical Approach:

The analysis and extraction of insights from the Vrinda store dataset involved these key steps:

Data Cleaning
Data Analysis
Data Visualization

🛠 Data Cleaning: The first step was to clean the data. This included removing duplicates and missing values, checking for spelling errors, and applying appropriate data formats.

📈 Data Analysis:
I aimed to answer the following questions:
1. Which month had the highest sales and orders?
2. Who purchases more, men or women?
3. Which channel contributes the most to sales?
4. Which top 5 states contribute the most to sales?
5. Which age group contributes the most to sales?
